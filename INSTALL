Installation
------------

Just compile the Gnome bundle : 

	make

and as superuser:

        make install

Now, just try to activate the theme (for example with SystemPrefrences.app)
and run a GNUstep program ... :-)

or type on the command line:

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSTheme GnomeTheme

Thanks, GC
